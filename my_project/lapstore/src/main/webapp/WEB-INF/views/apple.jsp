<p>The MacBook is a brand of notebook computers manufactured by Apple Inc. from May 2006 to February 2012, and relaunched in 2015. It replaced the iBook series and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Apple-Intel transition from PowerPC. Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,[1] the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets. It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.Collectively, the MacBook brand is the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops."
There have been four separate designs of the MacBook. The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminum casing, but omitted FireWire. A third design, introduced in late 2009, had a polycarbonate unibody casing.
On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchase as it had been effectively superseded by the MacBook Air whose starting price was lowered.Apple continued to sell the MacBook to educational institutions until February 2012.
A new, redesigned MacBook line was launched on March 9, 2015. Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional MagSafe charging port (along with all other ports, except the headphone jack) in favor of the multi-purpose USB-C port. It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option</p><p>he blade of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the 
reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. The bat is traditionally made
from willow wood, specifically from a variety of White Willow called Cricket Bat Willow (Salix alba var. caerulea),
treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is    very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at 
high speed, while also being light in weight. The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the 
user.</p>
<p>On October 20, 2009, Apple released a MacBook that introduced a new polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design,faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, and the ability to pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.
